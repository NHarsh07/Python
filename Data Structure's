# Python Data Structures: List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary

# 1. List
# A List is an ordered, mutable collection of items. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are defined using square brackets [] and can contain elements of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.).
# Lists are mutable, which means that you can change their contents after creation (adding, modifying, removing items).

# Example: Creating a List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing elements by index
print("First fruit:", fruits[0])   # Output: apple

# Modifying elements
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print("Modified list:", fruits)    # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']

# Adding elements to the list using append
fruits.append("orange")
print("After appending orange:", fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Removing elements from the list
fruits.remove("cherry")
print("After removing cherry:", fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'orange']

# List methods allow us to perform operations like sorting and reversing
print("Sorted list:", sorted(fruits))  # Temporary sorting: Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'orange']
fruits.reverse()
print("Reversed list:", fruits)        # Output: ['orange', 'blueberry', 'apple']
